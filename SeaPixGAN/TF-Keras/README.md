### Resources
- Implementation of **FUnIE-GAN** (paired and unpaired)
- Simplified implementations of **UGAN** and its variants ([original repo](https://github.com/cameronfabbri/Underwater-Color-Correction))
- Implementation: TensorFlow >= 1.11.0 and Keras >= 2.2 (Python 2.7)

### Usage
- Download the data, setup data-paths in the training scripts
- A few saved models are provided in models/
- Use the test scripts for evaluation
- Evaluation data is [provided here (on eval_data folder)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZEql33CajGfHHzPe1vFxUFCMcP0YbZb3?usp=sharing) for convenience
